# [Quranic Theme Explorer](https://quran-theme-explorer.vercel.app)

A web app that helps you explore the Quran through meaningful themes and search. Discover verses about mercy, patience, gratitude, and more with just a click.

## What I Built
A Quran theme explorer that lets users discover verses through meaningful themes like mercy and patience, plus a search feature for finding any topic.

## The Core Idea
Instead of making people search randomly, I created themed pathways into the Quran. Click "Divine Mercy" and instantly see verses about compassion and forgiveness. It's like having a guided tour through the Quran's key themes.

## Technical Approach
I used a modern web stack with Next.js for the framework, TypeScript for reliability, and Tailwind CSS for clean design. The real magic happens with the Quran Foundation API - it handles the complex search and returns authentic verse data.

## Challenge & Solution
The biggest hurdle was the API authentication. Their system uses OAuth2 which can be tricky, but I implemented their official SDK that handles all the security automatically. This meant I could focus on building a great user experience instead of wrestling with tokens.

## User Experience Focus
I kept it simple and intuitive - big colorful theme buttons up top, a clean search bar, and beautiful verse displays with Arabic text and English translations side by side. The app works perfectly on phones and computers.

## The Result
A fast, beautiful app that makes Quran exploration accessible and meaningful. Users can either follow the themed paths or forge their own with search - both leading to authentic Quranic verses.
